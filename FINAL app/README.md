Website Title: 

Warnell VR Headset Checkout System

Description: 

We created a Virtual Reality Headset Checkout System designed for the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources at UGA. The system allows students, faculty, and staff to easily sign up, log in, reserve VR headsets, return them, and communicate through a messaging feature. Additionally, this platform integrates with the YouTube API to help users search for VR-related or instructional videos directly from the checkout page.
